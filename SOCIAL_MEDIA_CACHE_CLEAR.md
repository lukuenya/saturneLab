# How to Clear Social Media Link Preview Cache

When you update your website's Open Graph meta tags, social media platforms may still show the old preview because they cache this information. Here's how to clear the cache for each platform:

## üîÑ Quick Links to Cache Clearing Tools

### Facebook & Messenger
**URL:** https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/

**Steps:**
1. Go to the Facebook Sharing Debugger
2. Enter your URL: `https://www.saturne-lab.com`
3. Click "Debug"
4. Click "Scrape Again" to force Facebook to fetch the new meta tags
5. Test both:
   - `https://www.saturne-lab.com`
   - `https://www.saturne-lab.com/fr`
   - `https://www.saturne-lab.com/en`

**Note:** This clears the cache for both Facebook and Messenger.

### LinkedIn
**URL:** https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/

**Steps:**
1. Go to the LinkedIn Post Inspector
2. Enter your URL: `https://www.saturne-lab.com`
3. Click "Inspect"
4. LinkedIn will fetch the latest meta tags

### WhatsApp
WhatsApp doesn't have an official cache clearing tool, but you can force it to refresh:

**Method 1: Wait (Recommended)**
- WhatsApp cache expires after 7 days
- After updating your meta tags, wait 7 days for automatic refresh

**Method 2: URL Parameters**
- Add a query parameter to force a new cache entry
- Example: `https://www.saturne-lab.com?v=2`
- This creates a new cache entry, but the original URL will still show old preview

**Method 3: Use Facebook Debugger**
- Since WhatsApp is owned by Meta, clearing Facebook's cache sometimes helps
- Use the Facebook Sharing Debugger (link above)

### Twitter/X
**URL:** https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator

**Steps:**
1. Go to the Twitter Card Validator
2. Enter your URL: `https://www.saturne-lab.com`
3. Click "Preview card"
